Phase 1: 
Use Fast API APP for creating Endponits to 
- List Files in a Folder
    List endpoint should read file name from path, and should validate there should not be any script or "." or ".." in path
- Get File
    get file should should show file if less than 25mb or download it.
- Upload File
    Upload file should read path form url path to upload.
- (No Delete yet, we don't want to delete files accidently)

''' main Idea
 Read configs
 - Get For_Storage_Primary location (required)
 - Get For_Storage_Secondary location (required)

 On Start
 - Check if config files exist, if not create one in home folder
 - Ask for Config locations,
 - both Location should cannot be same. (required)
 - if only one location provided show warning, only one location exists
 - Test App has permission to create file in the folder
 
 Can start simulteneously
 - Start comparing both location to see difference in file and store result in "storage_diff.txt"
 - store all the file location in a file so search can be implemented

Create APIs for
- Get Files in a folder
- Get File
- Create a folder
